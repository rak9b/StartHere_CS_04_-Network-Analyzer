# Network Packet Analyzer

A network packet analysis tool for monitoring and analyzing network traffic. This tool uses raw socket programming to capture packets and extract useful information such as protocol, IP addresses, ports, and payloads.

## Features
- Real-time packet capture and analysis.
- Support for Ethernet, IPv4, and TCP protocols.
- Logs packet details to a file (`packet_analysis.log`).
- Modular and extensible design.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** is required.
- Administrator/root privileges are necessary for packet capture.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-packet-analyzer.git
   cd network-packet-analyzer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### Running the Packet Analyzer
1. Use the provided example script for monitoring network traffic:
   ```bash
   python examples/monitor.py
   ```

2. Alternatively, use the `PacketAnalyzer` class directly:
   ```python
   from src.packet_analyzer import PacketAnalyzer

   analyzer = PacketAnalyzer()
   analyzer.start_capture()
   ```

### Stopping Packet Capture
Use `Ctrl+C` or send a termination signal to stop the packet capture gracefully.

---

## Testing
Run tests to ensure everything works as expected:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## Example Output
Sample log entry from `packet_analysis.log`:
```
2024-12-25 12:00:00 - INFO - TCP Packet | Src: 192.168.1.10:443 -> Dst: 192.168.1.20:5500 | Payload Size: 128 bytes
```
